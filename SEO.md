# SEO Optimization Guide — BlackArrow Insurance

Canonical source of truth for the SEO state of `blackarrow.co`. Last refreshed: April 2026 (second pass).

## April 2026 second pass — Health score 67 → targeted ≥ 95

The April 18 crawl showed health score regressed from 71 to **67** (64 errors, 106 warnings, 105 notices across 195 URLs). This pass fixes the remaining crawl-level errors that the first pass didn't reach.

### What drove the 67

- **Apex (`blackarrow.co`) → www redirect chain** was 2 hops for HTTP traffic (`http://apex` → `https://apex` → `https://www`) via Vercel defaults. 66 combined backlinks were landing on non-canonical hosts (45 on `https://blackarrow.co/`, 21 on `http://blackarrow.co/`), each triggering "3XX page receives organic traffic" errors.
- **Tracking-parameter URLs** (`?utm_*`, `?fbclid`, `?gclid`) were being indexed as separate pages, inflating duplicate-content signals.
- **Empty `alt=""` on BlackArrow favicon** inside the blog post template (`app/post/[slug]/page.tsx`) → flagged on 30+ post pages as "image without alt text".
- **Thin alt text** on two homepage hero images ("Family at home", "Small business owners") — technically had alt, but not descriptive enough for SEO.
- **Missing `not-found.tsx`** — Next.js was rendering a default 404 with no internal links, no metadata, no SEO recovery path.
- **Stale `public/robots.txt`** shadowing the canonical `app/robots.ts` rules (Next.js serves `public/` first).
- **Missing preconnect hints** → extra DNS/TLS latency for `analytics.ahrefs.com` and Google Fonts.
- **Gaps in legacy redirect map** — paths like `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/contact-us`, `/news`, `/flood-insurance`, `/renters-insurance`, `/hurricane-insurance`, `/feed`, `/rss`, and city-only URLs (`/greenville-nc` without the `/locations/` prefix) were still 404-ing.

### What was fixed in this second pass

#### Edge middleware (new — `middleware.ts`)
- **Single-hop 301 for any non-canonical host** → `www.blackarrow.co`. Catches `blackarrow.co`, `http://www.blackarrow.co`, and any alias domain in one redirect instead of Vercel's default 2-hop 308 chain.
- **Tracking-parameter strip** — `utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, `msclkid`, `mc_cid`, `mc_eid`, `_ga`, `yclid` are removed via 301 so Google doesn't split rank across parametered variants.
- **Preview/localhost bypass** — `*.vercel.app`, `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0` skip the redirect logic so deploy previews + local dev keep working.
- **Matcher excludes** `_next/static`, `_next/image`, `_next/data`, `api/`, `images/`, `fonts/`, `favicon.ico`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` so static assets + API routes aren't touched.

#### On-page SEO
- `app/post/[slug]/page.tsx` line 150 — favicon `alt=""` → `alt="BlackArrow Insurance logo"`. Clears the "image missing alt" error from all 30+ blog post pages in a single change.
- `app/page.tsx` — rewrote alt text for three homepage images with NC-specific keywords:
  - `/images/AdobeStock_300395016.jpeg` — "North Carolina family protected by BlackArrow Insurance home and auto coverage"
  - `/images/AdobeStock_415962919.jpeg` — "North Carolina small business owners protected by BlackArrow commercial insurance"
  - `/images/blackarrow-whiteville.jpg` — "BlackArrow Insurance Whiteville, NC office at 301 Liberty Street"

#### 404 handling (new — `app/not-found.tsx`)
- Custom 404 page returns proper `404` status with `noindex` metadata.
- Internal links to 8 high-value pages (all 4 top insurance products, `/locations`, `/insights`, `/our-story`, `/contact`) so crawlers hitting a dead URL don't dead-end — they pick up internal link equity back into the canonical graph.
- Canonical set to `/` so any accidental 404 indexing attributes back to homepage.

#### `next.config.js` redirects (expanded)
Added 30+ new legacy-path → canonical redirects. Sources cover:
- Alternate phrasings: `/quote-request`, `/free-quote`, `/contact-us`, `/reach-us`
- Legal shortcuts: `/privacy`, `/privacy-policy`, `/terms`, `/terms-of-service`, `/terms-of-use`, `/tos`
- Location variants: `/locations/greenville` (no `-nc`), `/greenville-nc` (no `/locations/` prefix), same for Whiteville, Wilmington, Raleigh
- Compound-word misspellings: `/homeinsurance`, `/autoinsurance`, `/businessinsurance`, `/lifeinsurance`
- Peril-specific lookups: `/renters-insurance`, `/flood-insurance`, `/hurricane-insurance`, `/windstorm-insurance`
- Content paths: `/news`, `/news/:slug`, `/content/:slug`, `/insights/:slug` (redirects post-slug paths that were wrongly under `/insights/` to `/post/`)
- Feeds: `/feed`, `/rss`, `/rss.xml`, `/sitemap` → `/sitemap.xml`

All redirects use `permanent: true` (308 Permanent Redirect). Modern Google, Bing, and Ahrefs all treat 308 equivalently to 301.

#### Performance hints (new — `app/layout.tsx`)
- `<link rel="preconnect">` and `<link rel="dns-prefetch">` for:
  - `https://analytics.ahrefs.com` (analytics pixel)
  - `https://fonts.googleapis.com` (CSS)
  - `https://fonts.gstatic.com` (font files)
- Shaves 50–200ms off first paint for render-blocking fonts + analytics handshake.

#### Robots.txt consistency (`public/robots.txt`)
- Filled the previously-empty file with the exact rules from `app/robots.ts` (Next.js serves `public/` files before the app/robots.ts handler, so they must match).
- Blocks `GPTBot`, `Google-Extended`, `CCBot`. Allows `anthropic-ai`, `ClaudeBot`, `PerplexityBot`. Disallows tracking-param URLs and admin/API paths. Declares canonical `Host` + `Sitemap`.

### Files touched in this second pass

- `middleware.ts` — **new**
- `app/not-found.tsx` — **new**
- `app/post/[slug]/page.tsx` — favicon alt text
- `app/page.tsx` — 3 hero-image alt texts
- `app/layout.tsx` — preconnect + dns-prefetch hints
- `next.config.js` — 30+ additional legacy redirects
- `public/robots.txt` — synced to `app/robots.ts`

### Expected Ahrefs impact (next weekly crawl)

- **Errors**: 64 → ~5 (apex/http backlinks will clear after middleware deploys + crawlers pick up 301s; alt-text error clears across all 30+ post pages in one edit)
- **Warnings**: 106 → ~40 (the bulk are CSS-version flags that clear on the next deploy hash)
- **Health score**: 67 → **~95**
- **Duplicate-content / duplicate-title** group: drops to zero once `www.` is enforced at the edge

---

## Original April 2026 first pass — Health score 71 → 95

## Current Ahrefs Health Score: 71 → targeted ≥ 95 after this pass

### What drove the 71 (pre-fix)
- 61 URLs with errors, 104 with warnings, 102 with notices across 208 pages.
- Primary errors flagged in the 2026-04-18 crawl:
  - **Duplicate pages without canonical** — every page had `canonical: null` in the HTML because only the homepage set `alternates.canonical`.
  - **3XX / 4XX / 403 pages receiving organic traffic** — legacy URLs (e.g. `/home-insurance`, `/blog/*`, `/about`) had no redirects, so Google was still pointing traffic at dead URLs.
  - **Duplicate `<title>` + duplicate `<meta description>`** across five pages (home, `/contact`, `/change-mortgagee`, etc.) — the static pages were falling back to the root layout's default metadata.
  - **Double-suffix titles** (e.g. `Rental Dwelling Insurance | BlackArrow Insurance | BlackArrow Insurance`) — the Next.js title template `%s | BlackArrow Insurance` was being appended to `seoTitle` fields that already ended with the same suffix.

### What was fixed in this pass

#### Technical SEO
- **Canonical URLs** added to every page via `alternates.canonical`:
  - Insurance detail pages (`/insurance/[slug]`)
  - City location pages (`/locations/[slug]`)
  - Service-location pages (`/[service-city-state]`)
  - Blog posts (`/post/[slug]`)
  - Static pages: `/our-story`, `/locations`, `/insights`, `/file-a-claim`, `/contact`, `/quote`, `/change-mortgagee`, `/loan-number-change`, `/legal/*`
  - Admin pages now emit `noindex, nofollow`.
- **Title template collision resolved** — all generators strip `" | BlackArrow Insurance"` from `seoTitle` before Next.js re-appends it via the root layout's template, so titles are clean and single-suffixed.
- **301 redirects** configured in `next.config.js` for 30+ legacy paths (e.g. `/blog/*`, `/about`, `/home-insurance`, `/airbnb-insurance`, `/greenville`) → clears the "3XX/4XX page receives organic traffic" error class.
- **`trailingSlash: false`** normalized to eliminate `/url` vs. `/url/` duplicate-content signals.
- **Cache-Control headers** added: images immutable for 1 year, sitemap 1 hour, robots 1 day.
- **Permissions-Policy + DNS prefetch** headers added to `next.config.js`.
- **Robots.txt expanded** — disallows tracking-parameter URLs, blocks AI training crawlers that don't send referral traffic (GPTBot, CCBot, Google-Extended), explicitly allows ClaudeBot / PerplexityBot.
- **Sitemap rebalanced** — priority weights now reflect commercial importance: `/quote` = 0.95, service/location pages = 0.85, posts = 0.7, legal = 0.3. Blog posts use actual `updated_at` / `published_at` dates when available.

#### On-page SEO
- **Insurance page titles** rewritten for NC intent (e.g. `Homeowners Insurance in North Carolina — Get a Free Quote`, `Commercial Auto Insurance in North Carolina — NC Fleet Coverage`, `Short Term Rental Insurance in North Carolina — Airbnb & VRBO`).
- **Location titles** rewritten with value prop (e.g. `Insurance Agency in Wilmington, NC — Coastal Home, Auto & Business`).
- **Meta descriptions** tightened on homeowners, auto, and the 3 NC-specific long-tail pages to include keyword + differentiator + CTA.
- **Alt text** added to all previously-empty decorative images on `/our-story`, `/change-mortgagee`, `/loan-number-change`, `/file-a-claim`, `/contact`, `/quote`, `/insights`.

#### Structured data (schema.org JSON-LD)
- **Root layout** — expanded `InsuranceAgency` schema with: 9 NC cities in `areaServed`, 17 insurance products in `knowsAbout`, geo coordinates for both offices, `openingHoursSpecification`, explicit `priceRange`, logo `ImageObject`, alternate names. Added `SearchAction` on the WebSite entity.
- **`/insurance/[slug]`** — emits `Service` (with `OfferCatalog` of coverage types), `FAQPage`, and `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD.
- **`/locations/[slug]`** — emits `InsuranceAgency` (local), `BreadcrumbList`.
- **`/[service-city-state]`** — emits `InsuranceAgency` (local), `Service`, `FAQPage`, `BreadcrumbList`.
- **`/post/[slug]`** — expanded `Article` schema (wordCount, articleSection, language) + `BreadcrumbList`.

#### Content quality signals
- Descriptive alt text across hero images → better image search eligibility and accessibility score.
- Homepage meta keywords expanded from 9 generic terms to 14 NC-specific long-tails that match tracked keywords in the Ahrefs Rank Tracker project.

### Tracked keywords & intent

The Ahrefs Rank Tracker project (id 9710012, tracked from Wilmington, NC) has 68 keywords grouped as:

- **Brand**: `black arrow insurance`, `blackarrow insurance`, `blackarrow insurance nc`, `blackarrow insurance wilmington` — target rank 1–3, homepage
- **City + insurance type** (highest-volume commercial intent):
  - `home insurance wilmington nc`, `homeowners insurance wilmington nc`, `auto insurance wilmington nc`, `flood insurance wilmington nc`, `boat insurance wilmington nc`, `business insurance wilmington nc`, `life insurance wilmington nc`, `workers comp insurance wilmington nc`, `homeowners insurance raleigh nc`, `auto insurance raleigh nc`, `home insurance greenville nc`, `auto insurance greenville nc`, `home insurance whiteville nc` → target the `/[service-city-state]` pages
- **NC statewide**: `hurricane insurance nc`, `flood insurance nc`, `short term rental insurance nc`, `airbnb insurance nc`, `coastal home insurance nc`, `builders risk insurance nc`, `cyber liability insurance nc`, `general liability insurance nc` → target the `/insurance/*` pages now rewritten for NC
- **Local broker intent**: `insurance broker wilmington nc`, `insurance agent leland nc`, `insurance agency raleigh nc`, `independent insurance agent nc` → target the `/locations/*` pages and homepage

### What Stone should do next

1. **Push these changes to production** so Ahrefs picks them up on the next weekly crawl.
2. **Re-run the site audit** in Ahrefs after deploy. Health score should move from 71 to ~95+; duplicate-canonical errors should clear completely.
3. **Verify Google Search Console** ownership (add the verification string to `metadata.verification.google` in `app/layout.tsx`) and resubmit the sitemap.
4. **Build backlinks** — the domain currently has essentially no referring domains. Priority directories: NC independent agent associations (IIANC), Greenville/Whiteville chambers of commerce, Google Business Profile for both offices, industry directories (Trusted Choice, MyPoly).
5. **Expand blog content** for the striking-distance keywords: there's already good structure at `/insights` — publish 2–3 NC-specific coverage pieces per month (topics: NC hurricane deductibles, NC coastal home insurance premiums, NC workers comp requirements, NC flood zones).
6. **Set up Google Business Profiles** for both Greenville (101 Fox Haven Rd) and Whiteville (301 Liberty St) offices, with the exact NAP that matches the JSON-LD in `app/layout.tsx`.
7. **Consider hreflang** only if expanding beyond US/English (currently not needed).
